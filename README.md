# Pie

Pie is a simple inference engine and knowledge base system in Rust. The project aims to provide efficient and scalable processing capabilities, leveraging Rust's safety and performance features, as well as creating a powerful inference engine.

## Features

- **Inference Engine**: Processes and evaluates logic rules.
- **Knowledge Base**: Manages and stores dynamic data for inference and decision-making.
- Modular design for ease of extension and integration.

## Project Structure

- `src/main.rs`: Entry point of the application.
- `src/inference_engine.rs`: Contains the logic for the inference engine.
- `src/knowledge_base.rs`: Implements the knowledge storage and retrieval mechanisms.
- `src/tests.rs`: Unit tests for the project components.
